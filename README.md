Hoping to finally save my Flutter projects hapa

## But first, Git states!
Modified State - Previously committed but with changes since last commit.
'''bash
    git add <filename>
'''

Tracked State  - Changes recognized by Git but yet to be staged for next commit.

Staged State   -  Changes that have been prepared for committing (usually with git add command)

Committed State - Changes now recognized in latest version of your project.
